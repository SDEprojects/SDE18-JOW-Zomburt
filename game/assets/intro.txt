In the distant year of 2021, an advanced infectious airborne disease has turned the population into Divoc Zombies.

All that remains are you and a few of your fellow Faction members. You must navigate through three heavily infected areas to find the magical antidote and locate your friends and family to free them
from a life of Divoc Suffering.

If you fail, you become a Divoc Zombie.
